# gpuforecasting
This repository includes the functions and code necessary to run single exponential smoothing of gpu card in matlab.
These m-files show the simulations of the working paper. Such a working paper has two simulations. The first simulation is run using the gpusimu1.m file and the graphs are obtained from the analyzegpusimu1.m. Analogously, the second simulation is described in gpusimu2.m and its plots are available in analyzegpusimu2.m

The different .mat files include the data and results obtained in the working paper.
Please, note that for running this simulations you need to have the toolbox required in MATLAB for using gpuarrays (an of course, a GPU card)
